# Spec Management

Create, transition, and validate documentation artifacts defined in AGENTS.md. The authoritative list of artifact types, phases, and hierarchy lives in AGENTS.md — this skill provides the operational procedures.

## Lifecycle table format

Every artifact embeds a lifecycle table tracking phase transitions:

```markdown
### Lifecycle

| Phase | Date | Commit | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Planned | 2026-02-24 | abc1234 | Initial creation |
| Active  | 2026-02-25 | def5678 | Dependency X satisfied |
```

Commit hashes reference the repo state at the time of the transition, not the commit that writes the hash stamp itself. Commit first, then stamp the hash and amend — the pre-amend hash is the correct value.

## Index maintenance

Every doc-type directory keeps a single lifecycle index (`list-<type>.md`). **Refreshing the index is the final step of every artifact operation** — creation, content edits, phase transitions, and abandonment. No artifact change is complete until the index reflects it.

### What "refresh" means

1. Read (or create) `docs/<type>/list-<type>.md`.
2. Ensure one table per active lifecycle phase, plus a table for each end-of-life phase that has entries.
3. For the affected artifact, update its row: title, current phase, last-updated date, and commit hash of the change.
4. If the artifact moved phases, remove it from the old phase table and add it to the new one.
5. Sort rows within each table by artifact number.

### When to refresh

| Operation | Trigger |
|-----------|---------|
| Create artifact | New row in the appropriate phase table |
| Edit artifact content or frontmatter | Update last-updated date and commit hash |
| Transition phase | Move row between phase tables |
| Abandon / end-of-life | Move row to the end-of-life table |

This rule is referenced as the **index refresh step** in the workflows below. Do not skip it.

## Creating artifacts

### Workflow

1. Scan `docs/<type>/` to determine the next available number for the prefix.
2. Create the artifact using the appropriate format (see AGENTS.md artifact types table).
3. Populate frontmatter with the required fields for the type (see the template in `references/<type>.md.j2`).
4. Initialize the lifecycle table with the appropriate phase and current date. This is usually the first phase (Draft, Planned, etc.), but an artifact may be created directly in a later phase if it was fully developed during the conversation (see [Phase skipping](#phase-skipping)).
5. Validate parent references exist (e.g., the Epic referenced by a new PRD must already exist).
6. **Index refresh step** — update `list-<type>.md` (see [Index maintenance](#index-maintenance)).

### Product Vision (VISION-NNN)

**Template:** [references/vision.md.j2](references/vision.md.j2)

The highest-level specification artifact. Follow **Marty Cagan's product vision model** (from *Inspired*): a Vision is a short, aspirational narrative describing the future you want to create for your customers. It communicates *why* the product exists, *who* it serves, and *what better state of the world* it enables — and nothing else.

A Vision is NOT a spec, NOT a feature list, NOT a roadmap, NOT a technical architecture document, and NOT a tracking artifact. If content describes *how* the system is built, *what* technologies it uses, *when* things ship, or *which tasks* remain, it belongs in a child artifact (Epic, PRD, ADR, Spike), not the Vision.

- **Folder structure:** `docs/vision/(VISION-NNN)-<Title>/`
  - Primary file: `(VISION-NNN)-<Title>.md` — the vision document itself.
  - Supporting docs live alongside it in the same folder. These are NOT numbered artifacts — they are informal reference material owned by the Vision.
  - Typical supporting docs: competitive analysis, market research, positioning docs, persona summaries, **architecture overview**.
- **Architecture overview vs. ADRs:** An `architecture-overview.md` in the Vision folder describes *how the system works holistically* — a living description of the system shape. It is descriptive, not decisional. Individual architectural *decisions* ("we chose X over Y because Z") belong in ADRs. When extracting architecture content from a Vision document, split it: the holistic description stays as a Vision supporting doc; discrete decisions with alternatives considered become ADRs.
- Should be stable — update infrequently. If a Vision needs frequent revision, it is likely scoped too narrowly (should be an Epic) or too early (needs a Spike first).
- Should fit on roughly one page. If a Vision is growing beyond that, extract detail into supporting docs or child artifacts.
- Vision documents do NOT contain: implementation details, technical analysis, timelines, task breakdowns, tracking tables, dependency graphs, or phase-by-phase rollout plans.

### User Journey (JOURNEY-NNN)

**Template:** [references/journey.md.j2](references/journey.md.j2)

Maps an end-to-end user experience across features and touchpoints. Journeys describe *how a user accomplishes a goal* and surface pain points and opportunities that inform which Epics to create.

- **Folder structure:** `docs/journey/(JOURNEY-NNN)-<Title>/`
  - Primary file: `(JOURNEY-NNN)-<Title>.md` — the journey narrative.
  - Supporting docs: flow charts, interview notes, extended research.
- A Journey is "Validated" when its steps and pain points have been confirmed through user research, stakeholder review, or prototype testing.
- Journeys are *discovery artifacts* — they inform Epic and PRD creation but are not directly implemented. They do NOT contain acceptance criteria or task breakdowns.

#### Mermaid journey diagram

Every journey MUST include a Mermaid `journey` diagram embedded in the primary file. The diagram is a structured visualization of the narrative — it encodes stages, actions, satisfaction levels, and actors in a single view. Place the diagram immediately after the **Steps / Stages** section.

**Syntax:**

~~~markdown
```mermaid
journey
    title <Journey Title>
    section <Stage Name>
      <Action>: <score>: <Actor>
```
~~~

**Mapping conventions:**

| Journey element | Mermaid element | Rule |
|-----------------|-----------------|------|
| Steps / stages | `section` blocks | One section per stage, in narrative order |
| Actions within a stage | Task lines | Concise verb phrases (3-6 words) |
| Persona | Actor name | Use the persona's archetype label from its PERSONA-NNN, not the artifact ID |
| System / other actors | Additional actors | Add when a handoff or interaction with another party occurs |

**Satisfaction scores** (1–5 scale):

| Score | Sentiment | Signals |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 5 | Delighted | Moment of delight, exceeds expectations |
| 4 | Satisfied | Works well, minor friction at most |
| 3 | Neutral | Functional but unremarkable |
| 2 | Frustrated | Noticeable friction — flags a **pain point** |
| 1 | Blocked | Severe friction or failure — flags a critical **pain point** |

Every pain point identified in the narrative MUST appear as a score ≤ 2 task in the diagram, and every score ≤ 2 task MUST have a corresponding pain point in the narrative. This keeps the diagram and narrative in sync.

**Example:**

~~~markdown
```mermaid
journey
    title First-Time Project Setup
    section Discovery
      Find product landing page: 4: Developer
      Read getting-started guide: 3: Developer
    section Installation
      Install CLI tool: 5: Developer
      Run init command: 4: Developer
      Configure credentials: 2: Developer
    section First Use
      Create first project: 4: Developer
      Invite team member: 1: Developer, Admin
      Run first build: 5: Developer
```
~~~

In this example, "Configure credentials" (2) and "Invite team member" (1) surface as pain points — the narrative must describe the corresponding friction and opportunities.

**Workflow integration:**

- When creating a journey, draft the narrative first, then build the diagram from it. The diagram is a *derived visualization*, not the source of truth — the narrative is.
- When updating a journey (adding stages, revising pain points), update **both** the narrative and the diagram in the same commit.
- When transitioning a journey to Validated, confirm that satisfaction scores reflect validated research findings, not initial assumptions. Adjust scores as user feedback dictates.

### Epics (EPIC-NNN)

**Template:** [references/epic.md.j2](references/epic.md.j2)

A strategic initiative that decomposes into multiple PRDs, Spikes, and ADRs. The **coordination layer** between product vision and feature-level work.

- An Epic is "Complete" when all child PRDs reach "Implemented" and success criteria are met.
- An Epic is "Archived" after completion, when it no longer requires active reference.

### User Story (STORY-NNN)

**Template:** [references/story.md.j2](references/story.md.j2)

The atomic unit of user-facing requirements. Captures a single capability from the user's perspective with clear acceptance criteria. Decomposes an Epic into verifiable, implementable increments.

- **Format:** Single markdown file at `docs/story/(STORY-NNN)-<Title>.md`.
- Stories should be small enough to implement and verify independently. If a story requires multiple PRDs, it is likely scoped too broadly (should be an Epic).
- A Story is "Ready" when acceptance criteria are defined and agreed upon. A Story is "Implemented" when all acceptance criteria pass.

### PRDs (PRD-NNN)

**Template:** [references/prd.md.j2](references/prd.md.j2)

- Should be scoped to something a team (or agent) can ship and validate independently.

### Research Spikes (SPIKE-NNN)

**Template:** [references/spike.md.j2](references/spike.md.j2)

- Number in intended execution order — sequence communicates priority.
- Gating spikes must define go/no-go criteria with measurable thresholds (not just "investigate X").
- Gating spikes must recommend a specific pivot if the gate fails (not just "reconsider approach").
- Spikes can belong to any artifact type (Vision, Epic, PRD, ADR, Persona). The owning artifact controls all spike tables: questions, risks, gate criteria, dependency graph, execution order, phase mappings, and risk coverage. There is no separate research roadmap document.

### Personas (PERSONA-NNN)

**Template:** [references/persona.md.j2](references/persona.md.j2)

A user archetype that represents a distinct segment of the product's audience. Personas are cross-cutting — they are referenced by Journeys, Stories, Visions, and other artifacts but are not owned by any single one.

- **Folder structure:** `docs/persona/(PERSONA-NNN)-<Title>/`
  - Primary file: `(PERSONA-NNN)-<Title>.md` — the persona definition.
  - Supporting docs: interview notes, survey data, behavioral research, demographic analysis.
- A Persona is "Validated" when its attributes have been confirmed through user research, interviews, or data analysis — not just assumed.
- Personas are *reference artifacts* — they inform Journey, Story, and PRD creation but are not directly implemented. They do NOT contain acceptance criteria, task breakdowns, or feature specifications.

### ADRs (ADR-NNN)

**Template:** [references/adr.md.j2](references/adr.md.j2)

- **Directory structure:** `docs/adr/<Phase>/(ADR-NNN)-<Title>.md` — each ADR is a single Markdown file placed in the subdirectory matching its current lifecycle phase. Phase subdirectories: `Draft/`, `Proposed/`, `Adopted/`, `Retired/`, `Superseded/`.
  - Example: `docs/adr/Adopted/(ADR-001)-Subtree-Split-Distribution-Model.md`
  - When transitioning phases, **move the file** to the new phase directory (e.g., `git mv docs/adr/Draft/(ADR-003)-Foo.md docs/adr/Proposed/(ADR-003)-Foo.md`).
  - **Never** store ADRs flat in `docs/adr/` with phase tracked only in frontmatter — the directory structure must reflect the phase.
- ADRs are cross-cutting: they link to all affected artifacts but are not owned by any single one.
- ADRs record **decisions**: a specific choice between alternatives, with rationale and consequences. They require status, alternatives considered, and a decision outcome.
- ADRs are NOT for descriptive or explanatory architecture content. If the content describes "how the system works" without presenting a decision between alternatives, it belongs as an architecture overview supporting doc in the Vision folder — not as an ADR.
- Use the Draft phase while investigation (Spikes) is still in progress. Move to Proposed when the recommendation is formed and ready for review.

## Phase transitions

### Phase skipping

Phases listed in AGENTS.md are available waypoints, not mandatory gates. An artifact may skip intermediate phases and land directly on a later phase in the sequence. This is normal in single-user workflows where drafting and review happen conversationally in the same session.

- The lifecycle table records only the phases the artifact actually occupied — one row per state it landed on, not rows for states it skipped past.
- Skipping is forward-only: an artifact cannot skip backward in its phase sequence.
- **Abandoned** is a universal end-of-life phase available from any state, including Draft. It signals the artifact was intentionally not pursued. Use it instead of deleting artifacts — the record of what was considered and why it was dropped is valuable.
- Other end-of-life transitions (Sunset, Retired, Superseded, Archived, Deprecated) require the artifact to have been in an active state first — you cannot skip directly from Draft to Retired.

### Workflow

1. Validate the target phase is reachable from the current phase (same or later in the sequence; intermediate phases may be skipped).
2. Update the artifact's status field in frontmatter.
3. Commit the change.
4. Append a row to the artifact's lifecycle table with the commit hash from step 3.
5. Amend the commit to include the hash stamp.
6. **Index refresh step** — move the artifact's row to the new phase table (see [Index maintenance](#index-maintenance)).

### Completion rules

- An Epic is "Complete" only when all child PRDs are "Implemented" and success criteria are met.
- A PRD is "Implemented" only when its implementation plan is closed (or all tasks are done in fallback mode).
- An ADR is "Superseded" only when the superseding ADR is "Adopted" and links back.

## Implementation plans

Implementation plans are not a doc-type artifact. They bridge declarative specs (`docs/`) and execution tracking. All concrete CLI operations are handled by the **execution-tracking** skill — this skill describes *what* to do, not *how*.

### Prerequisites

Before creating or modifying implementation plans, invoke the **execution-tracking** skill to bootstrap the task backend (availability check, installation if missing, initialization). That skill owns the install, recovery, and CLI command layer.

### Seeding a plan from a spec

1. A PRD (or Epic) may include an "Implementation Approach" section sketching the high-level plan. This seeds the implementation plan but is not the plan of record.
2. When work begins, create an **implementation plan** for the spec artifact, linked via an **origin ref** (e.g., `PRD-003`).
3. Create **tasks** under the implementation plan with dependencies between them. Tag each task with a **spec tag** for the originating spec.

### Lineage and cross-spec impact

- Every implementation plan has an **origin ref** — an immutable link to the spec that seeded it.
- Every task carries one or more **spec tags** — mutable labels recording which specs it currently affects.
- When a task impacts additional specs, add spec tags for the new specs and create **dependencies** linking related tasks across plans.
- Track provenance when tasks spawn from existing ones.

### Parallel coordination

- Use the execution-tracking skill's parallel coordination features (swarms, formulas) when multiple agents need to pick up **ready work** from the same implementation plan.

### Closing the loop

- Progress is tracked in the execution backend, not in the spec doc. The PRD's lifecycle table records the transition to "Implemented" once the implementation plan completes.
- Cross-spec tasks should be noted in each affected artifact's lifecycle table entry (e.g., "Implemented — shared serializer also covers PRD-007").

### Fallback

If the **execution-tracking** skill is not available in the current agent environment, fall back to the agent's built-in todo system with canonical states (`todo`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`). The plan structure (ordered steps, dependencies, completion tracking) remains the same — only the backend changes. Lineage is maintained by including artifact IDs in task titles or notes (e.g., `[PRD-003] Add export endpoint`).
